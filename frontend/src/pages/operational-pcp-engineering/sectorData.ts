    { q: 'Is this route suitable for engineering and manufacturing?', a: 'Yes. This Operational PCP route is tailored for engineering, manufacturing, aerospace, medicals and pharmaceutical sectors. It addresses regulated delivery, complex production dependencies and quality compliance.' },
    { q: 'What makes this different from the construction route?', a: 'While core project controls skills are the same, this route focuses on manufacturing and engineering-specific challenges: supplier milestone tracking, regulated documentation, quality compliance and technical programme control.' },
    { q: 'Which roles benefit most?', a: 'Planners, cost engineers, project controllers, quality assurance professionals, production planners and PMO analysts in engineering, manufacturing, aerospace, medical devices and pharmaceuticals.' },
    { q: 'How does this support regulated industries?', a: 'The programme emphasises audit-ready documentation, governance frameworks and compliance-aware project controls. Relevant for aerospace (AS9100), medical devices (ISO 13485) and pharmaceuticals (GxP) environments.' },
    { q: 'Can apprenticeship funding support this route?', a: `The Level 6 standard has a maximum funding band of ${pcpFundingBand}. The amount available depends on the current rules, learner age, employer status and available levy funds. Funding is confirmed only after an individual eligibility review.` },
    { q: 'What determines the employer contribution?', a: `For starts from ${apprenticeshipFundingPolicy.appliesFromLabel}, contribution rates vary by learner age, whether the employer pays the levy and whether sufficient levy funds are available. Workplace location, role relevance, prior learning and the applicable start-date rules must also be checked.` },
    { q: 'How is the programme delivered?', a: 'Delivery includes live online sessions (2 hours per week), guided reading, portfolio building, monthly one-to-one coaching and tripartite progress reviews every 10 weeks.' },
    { q: 'Can employers enrol multiple learners?', a: 'Yes. Many employers enrol cohorts across planning, cost, risk and quality functions. Group delivery can be arranged for organisations building controls capability at scale.' },
