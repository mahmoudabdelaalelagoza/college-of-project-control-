  { q: 'Is this route specifically designed for construction projects?', a: 'Yes. The Construction and Urban PCP route includes NEC contract awareness, construction scheduling techniques, subcontractor interface management, progress measurement methods and construction-specific risk and change control. Learners apply these directly to live construction projects.' },

It does not replace legal or commercial training but builds the project controls discipline that supports effective NEC administration.' },

  { q: 'How quickly can we see improvement on live projects?', a: 'Learners apply their development directly to live projects from the start. The intended application includes schedule review, progress reporting and change control. Outcomes depend on the learner, role and employer support.' },
