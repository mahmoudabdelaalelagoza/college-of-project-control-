  { q: 'Is this route specifically designed for energy and capital programmes?', a: 'Yes. The Energy and Net Zero PCP route includes capital programme control techniques, integrated cost and schedule management, regulatory awareness, multi-contractor interface management, commissioning and outage planning, and risk management for complex delivery environments.' },
  { q: 'Does this cover regulatory and safety requirements?', a: 'The programme builds the project controls discipline that supports regulatory compliance, including structured documentation, audit-ready reporting and evidence-based progress tracking. It does not replace compliance or safety training but strengthens the controls framework around it.' },
  { q: 'Which roles benefit most from this route?', a: 'Cost engineers, planners, risk managers, project controllers and programme controls professionals working in energy, oil and gas, utilities, infrastructure and net zero capital programmes. Employers building internal project controls teams also benefit significantly.' },
  { q: 'Can this support net zero and energy transition programmes?', a: 'Yes. The project controls discipline is directly applicable to net zero and energy transition programmes, where capital programme governance, cost assurance, risk management and integrated forecasting are critical to delivery confidence.' },
