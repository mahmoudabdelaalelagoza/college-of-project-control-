# campaign/energy sections

Composition: [page.tsx](page.tsx). Routes: `/campaign/energy`.

Find the label on the page, then open its component below. Shared implementation links are provided where a section is reused. Data and API calls retain their existing ownership.

Section copy, repeated items and configuration:

- [campaignData.ts](campaignData.ts)

Keep `page.tsx` focused on section order and page state. Add new page-specific sections to `components/`, use the visible label for the filename, and update imports when renaming. Shared navigation and the footer remain in `src/components/feature/`.
