export const faqs = [
  { q: 'Is apprenticeship funding available for public sector employers?', a: 'Yes. Public sector employers in England — including councils, local authorities, government departments and arm&apos;s-length bodies — can access apprenticeship funding. Levy-paying organisations use their levy. Non-levy-paying public sector employers can access co-funded options.' },
  { q: 'How does this address public accountability requirements?', a: 'The Public Sector PCP route builds project controls capability designed for public scrutiny. This includes audit-ready reporting, structured governance frameworks, clear accountability, evidence-based progress tracking and benefits realisation management.' },
  { q: 'Can councils use this for transformation and digital programmes?', a: 'Yes. The project controls discipline applies to transformation, digital and change programmes as much as to capital projects. The governance, reporting, risk and benefits management capability is directly transferable.' },
  { q: 'What about programmes funded by multiple sources?', a: 'The programme builds reporting and governance capability that can satisfy the requirements of multiple funding streams, including central government grants, capital allocations and revenue budgets — with clear audit trails.' },
