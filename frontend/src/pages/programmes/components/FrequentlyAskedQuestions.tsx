    q: 'Which programme is right for me?',
    a: 'Start with your current responsibilities and the capability you want to strengthen. Project Controls Professional Level 6 suits professionals across planning, scheduling, cost, risk, controls and PMO. Associate Project Manager Level 4 suits professionals developing broader project-management and delivery responsibility. Certified PMO Professional Level 6 suits experienced professionals developing strategic PMO governance.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between Project Controls Professional Level 6 and Associate Project Manager Level 4?',
    a: 'Project Controls Professional Level 6 focuses on advanced Project Controls capability, while Associate Project Manager Level 4 builds broader project-management and delivery responsibility at Level 4. The right programme depends on your role and the level of responsibility you hold.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Who is Certified PMO Professional Level 6 designed for?',
    a: 'Experienced PMO, Project Controls and project professionals developing strategic governance, integrated controls, assurance and PMO leadership capability.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between a programme and a specialist module?',
    a: 'A complete programme provides structured development across a broader professional capability. A specialist module focuses on one specific Project Controls subject, which can be taken individually or combined with others.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I take individual Project Controls modules?',
    a: 'Yes. Specialist Project Controls modules can be taken individually, allowing you to target one specific capability rather than a complete programme.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I combine several modules?',
    a: 'Yes. You can combine several specialist Project Controls subjects around your role, project environment or organisational capability needs.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can my employer support my development?',
    a: 'Yes. Employers can support development for an individual, a team or a wider Project Controls function, either directly or through structured employer development.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can organisations enrol multiple employees?',
    a: 'Yes. Organisations can build capability across roles, teams, PMOs or functions through structured employer development.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are programmes designed for working professionals?',
    a: 'Yes. Programmes are designed for working professionals, with development structured to fit alongside existing responsibilities.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does workplace application work?',
    a: 'Development is designed to connect specialist learning directly to live projects, systems and responsibilities, so you can apply what you learn in real work.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What professional pathways are connected to the programmes?',
    a: 'Selected programmes connect with relevant professional qualifications, assessments, memberships and progression pathways. These remain subject to the requirements of the relevant professional body.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does completing a programme automatically award ChPP?',
    a: 'No. Development can support Chartered Progression towards ChPP, but Chartered status is awarded by APM based on its own requirements and is not automatically awarded on completion of a programme.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I speak with the College before choosing?',
    a: 'Yes. Contact the College to discuss your role, responsibilities or team capability needs, and we will help identify the most relevant professional-development option.',
