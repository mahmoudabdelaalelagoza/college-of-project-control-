    { q: 'Is this route tailored for public sector project controls?', a: 'Yes. This Operational PCP route is specifically designed for public sector, council and government delivery contexts. It addresses value-for-money requirements, public accountability, governance frameworks and benefits realisation.' },
    { q: 'Who is this route for?', a: 'Project controllers, PMO analysts, planners, schedulers and cost engineers working in local authorities, central government, NHS trusts, education, transport authorities, and other public sector bodies.' },
    { q: 'How does the apprenticeship levy affect public sector employers?', a: 'Public sector organisations that pay the apprenticeship levy can use their levy funds to cover the cost of this programme. Many public sector bodies have significant levy pots that can be used to support project controls capability development.' },
    { q: 'How does this support public accountability?', a: 'The programme emphasises audit-ready evidence, transparent reporting, governance frameworks and benefits realisation tracking — all essential for demonstrating value-for-money and public accountability.' },
    { q: 'Can apprenticeship funding support this route?', a: `The Level 6 standard has a maximum funding band of ${pcpFundingBand}. The amount available depends on the current rules, learner age, employer status and available levy funds. Funding is confirmed only after an individual eligibility review.` },
    { q: 'What determines the employer contribution?', a: `For starts from ${apprenticeshipFundingPolicy.appliesFromLabel}, contribution rates vary by learner age, whether the employer pays the levy and whether sufficient levy funds are available. Workplace location, role relevance, prior learning and the applicable start-date rules must also be checked.` },
    { q: 'How is the programme delivered?', a: 'Delivery includes live online sessions (2 hours per week), guided reading, portfolio building, monthly one-to-one coaching and tripartite progress reviews every 10 weeks.' },
    { q: 'Can employers enrol multiple learners?', a: 'Yes. Many employers enrol cohorts across programme controls, planning and governance functions. Group delivery can be arranged for organisations building capability at scale.' },
