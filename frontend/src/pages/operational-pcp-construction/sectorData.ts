  faqs: [
    { q: 'Is this route specific to construction project controls?', a: 'Yes. This Operational PCP route is tailored for construction, building and urban development programmes. It focuses on NEC contract management, scheduling for build programmes, subcontractor coordination and construction-specific progress reporting.' },
    { q: 'What construction-specific skills will I develop?', a: 'NEC change control, construction programme scheduling, critical path analysis for build sequences, subcontractor progress tracking, earned value on construction projects, and construction-specific risk and cost management.' },
    { q: 'Who is this route for?', a: 'Planners, schedulers, cost engineers, project controllers and PMO analysts working in construction, building, urban development and civil engineering. Also suitable for assistant project managers and site-based project support staff moving into project controls.' },
    { q: 'How does this support my construction career?', a: 'The programme builds directly applicable skills for construction project controls. Workplace evidence is gathered from your actual construction projects. This makes the qualification immediately relevant to your employer and your career progression.' },
    { q: 'Can apprenticeship funding support this route?', a: `The Level 6 standard has a maximum funding band of ${pcpFundingBand}. The amount available depends on the current rules, learner age, employer status and available levy funds. Funding is confirmed only after an individual eligibility review.` },
    { q: 'What determines the employer contribution?', a: `For starts from ${apprenticeshipFundingPolicy.appliesFromLabel}, contribution rates vary by learner age, whether the employer pays the levy and whether sufficient levy funds are available. Workplace location, role relevance, prior learning and the applicable start-date rules must also be checked.` },
    { q: 'How is the programme delivered?', a: 'Delivery includes live online sessions (2 hours per week), guided reading, portfolio building, monthly one-to-one coaching and tripartite progress reviews every 10 weeks.' },
    { q: 'Can employers enrol multiple learners?', a: 'Yes. Many employers enrol cohorts across planning, cost, risk and PMO functions. Group delivery can be arranged for organisations building controls capability at scale.' },
