export const faqs = [
  { q: 'When do the courses start?', a: 'Start windows are September, January and April. Availability and module sequence depend on the pathway and confirmed intake.' },
  { q: 'How long is the programme?', a: 'The programme is 27 months: a one-month soft start, 24 months for six credits and two months of closing workshops.' },
  { q: 'Can I tailor the programme rather than follow one standard route?', a: 'Yes, subject to current job duties, employer needs, evidence opportunities, employer engagement and approval.' },
  { q: 'Can modules from another level be used if they better match my role?', a: 'Potentially, subject to programme fit, evidence requirements and funding rules. A normal module is one credit over four months; PMP or another relevant two-credit route is eight months.' },
  { q: 'What is the eligibility for the fully funded apprenticeship route?', a: 'Important considerations include living and working in England, spending at least 50% of working time in England, employment, employer support for off-the-job learning, applicable minimum-wage requirements and final pre-enrolment checks. This is guidance, not an unconditional funding or legal determination.' },
  { q: 'What if I am not eligible for apprenticeship funding?', a: 'An Institute of Project Controls supported route may be explored for some international, unemployed, self-employed or otherwise ineligible applicants. Applications may request a CV, positive-character statement and future-goals statement. Support is subject to eligibility, approval and availability.' },
  { q: 'Which route should I choose for Chartered Project Professional progression?', a: 'The Chartered Pathway is designed for this priority. Completing it does not automatically award ChPP; Chartered Project Professional status is awarded only by the Association for Project Management after its full requirements are met.' },
  { q: 'Do all pathways support IPC Fellowship and Incorporated Cost Engineer progression?', a: 'The programme is intended to support progression towards these forms of recognition. Final recognition remains subject to the awarding organisation’s requirements.' },
  { q: 'Is the Level 7 Diploma in Strategy and Leadership included?', a: 'Access is included as part of the wider support package, subject to confirmed terms. Sessions run Saturdays, 9:00–11:00, across six three-month modules over 18 months. It is additional development, not part of the six Level 6 credits.' },
  { q: 'What does the funding package include?', a: 'The potential Department for Education package covers training, EPA, coaching and materials. The potential IPC package may cover memberships, exams, Level 7 access, Masterclasses, clubs, healthcare and graduation. Every element is conditional and confirmed in writing.' },
  { q: 'Is the programme suitable outside engineering and construction?', a: 'Yes. Cohort materials can be oriented towards engineering, construction and infrastructure or towards business, consultancy, digital and service-sector projects.' },
  { q: 'What is the best next step?', a: 'Request a one-to-one consultation so the team can review your duties, employer position, funding, cohort orientation and pathway.' },
