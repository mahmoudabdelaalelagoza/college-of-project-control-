    { q: 'What energy-specific project controls skills will I develop?', a: 'Capital programme baseline management, integrated cost and schedule forecasting across long lifecycles, contractor programme control, outage and commissioning milestone management, and regulatory assurance reporting.' },
    { q: 'Which energy sectors does this cover?', a: 'Oil and gas, renewable energy, nuclear, utilities (water, electricity, gas), net zero transition programmes, and energy infrastructure. Any capital-intensive energy programme where project controls maturity is critical.' },
    { q: 'How does this support net zero programmes?', a: 'Net zero programmes combine capital complexity with regulatory oversight and public accountability. This route builds the project controls capability needed to manage these programmes with confidence.' },
    { q: 'Can apprenticeship funding support this route?', a: `The Level 6 standard has a maximum funding band of ${pcpFundingBand}. The amount available depends on the current rules, learner age, employer status and available levy funds. Funding is confirmed only after an individual eligibility review.` },
    { q: 'What determines the employer contribution?', a: `For starts from ${apprenticeshipFundingPolicy.appliesFromLabel}, contribution rates vary by learner age, whether the employer pays the levy and whether sufficient levy funds are available. Workplace location, role relevance, prior learning and the applicable start-date rules must also be checked.` },
    { q: 'How is the programme delivered?', a: 'Delivery includes live online sessions (2 hours per week), guided reading, portfolio building, monthly one-to-one coaching and tripartite progress reviews every 10 weeks.' },
    { q: 'Can employers enrol multiple learners?', a: 'Yes. Many employers enrol cohorts across project controls, planning and risk functions. Group delivery can be arranged for organisations building controls capability at scale.' },
